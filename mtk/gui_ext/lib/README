1.  libutils.so
2.  libcutils.so
3.  libbinder.so
4.  libhardware.so
5.  libhardware_legacy.so
5.  libgui.so
6.  libui.so
7.  libdl.so
8.  libion.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libion_mtk.so
2.  libgralloc_extra.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/proprietary/hardware/gui_ext/' folder.
