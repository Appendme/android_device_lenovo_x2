IPsec Starter -- Version 0.2        [Contributed by Arkoon Network Security]
============================        [                http://www.arkoon.net/]

IPsec Starter is aimed to replace all the scripts which are used to
start and stop strongSwan and to do that in a quicker and a smarter way.

IPsec Starter can also reload the configuration file (kill --HUP or periodicaly)
and apply the changes.

Usage:
  starter [--debug] [--auto_update <x seconds>]
    --debug:       enable debugging output
    --no_fork:     all msg (including pluto) are sent to the console
    --auto_update: reload the config file (like kill -HUP) every x seconds
                   and determine any configuration changes

FEATURES
--------

o Load modules of the native Linux 2.6 IPsec stack

o Launch and monitor pluto

o Add, initiate, route and del connections

o Attach and detach interfaces according to config file

o kill -HUP can be used to reload the config file. New connections will be
  added, old ones will be removed and modified ones will be reloaded.
  Interfaces/Klips/Pluto will be reloaded if necessary.

o Full support of the %defaultroute wildcard parameter.

o save own pid in /var/run/starter

o Upon reloading, dynamic DNS addr will be resolved and reloaded. Use
  --auto_update to periodicaly check dynamic DNS changes.

o kill -USR1 can be used to reload all connections (delete then add and
  route/initiate)

o /var/run/dynip/xxxx can be used to use a virtual interface name in
  ipsec.conf. By example, when adsl can be ppp0, ppp1, ... :
    ipsec.conf:             interfaces="ipsec0=adsl"
  And use /etc/ppp/ip-up to create /var/run/dynip/adsl
    /var/run/dynip/adsl:    IP_PHYS=ppp0

o %auto can be used to automaticaly name the connections

o kill -TERM can be used to stop FS. pluto will be stopped.

o Can be used to start strongSwan and load lots of connections in a few
  seconds.

TODO
----

o handle wildcards in include lines -- use glob() fct
    ex: include /etc/ipsec.*.conf

o handle duplicates keywords and sections

o 'also' keyword not supported

o manually keyed connections

o IPv6

o Documentation
